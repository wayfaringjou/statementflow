# 'Statementflow'

[Live App](https://statementflow.vercel.app/).

## Description

'Statementflow' is meant to be a tool to help accountants in the preparation of financial statements. The first version of this project offers basic functionality that can serve as a good foundation for further development.

## Further goals for this project
For this first version there is one template available: "Personal Financial Statement (Compilation)". 

In future versions I expect to let users create their own templates using the client app. For now, templates have to be created as a JSON document and added using the API.

## Summary
The client-side application can interpret template data stored as JSON to generate a form that can serves as a guide to help the user in the preparation of a financial statement.

Users can store financial data for their clients and export that data in Docx format to use as a starting point for an oficial compilation for their clients.
